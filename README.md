# curlify
WebExtension based browser addon to generate CURL request including all cookies.

This extension adds an action button which upon click will generate a `curl` command for the tab's current URL including *all* cookies
available for the site, i.e. *including HTTP only* cookies. Essentially this is for hijacking your own session towards CURL.
